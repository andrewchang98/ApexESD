# ApexESD (Electronic Spotter Device)
UNDER NO SITUATION IS AN ELECTRONIC SPOTTER DEVICE A REPLACEMENT FOR A HUMAN SPOTTER.

MOTIVATION: Fatalities and serious injuries are a tragic reality which is all too common within high-risk sports. ApexESD comes into play by monitoring a stretch of open road by electronically monitoring a single point along the road using what is essentially a 'invisible laser tripwire.' ApexESD aims to reduce accidents by providing the operator with 99.9% confidence the course is clear.

[1] ABSTRACT: ApexESD is an open-source electronic vehicle/automobile/motorcycle/pedestrian/wildlife detection tripwire with PTT capabilities compatible with Baofeng radios (UV-5R, BF-F8HP). ApexESD utilizes LiDAR single-point ranging modules to monitor traffic on roads. ApexESD connects to radios via a stardard Kenwood double-jack PTT connector. When ApexESD detects an anomaly (significant change in range value), an audio signal is sent and broadcasted from the radio, allowing the operator to detect potential oncoming traffic in advance. When setup appropriately, ApexESD helps to secure blind corners, tight spots, and start/finish lines.
